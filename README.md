# xGBoom
# This model was created to analyze the xG (expected goals) of a team in a soccer match. Took into account many features pertaining to a shot - such as it's X and Y position, type of play, etc. - and used them to calculate the xG, serving as an indicator of the quality of the chances taken by that team.








# Tools used: Datasets featuring shot statistics from https://github.com/douglasbc/scraping-understat-dataset by douglasbc.
