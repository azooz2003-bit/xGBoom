# xGBoom
# This program was created to analyze the xG (expected goals) of a team in a soccer match. We took into account many features pertaining to a shot - such as it's X and Y position, type of play, etc. - and used them to calculate the xG, serving as an indicator of the quality of that chance.








# Tools used: Datasets featuring shot statistics from https://github.com/douglasbc/scraping-understat-dataset by douglasbc.
